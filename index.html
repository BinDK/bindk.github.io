Hi, I'm Rebecca. Welcome to Kaltura's video tips. Where we show you some easy ways to make better videos. In this session, we're going to focus on how to prepare for your video.

Preparation is a key element to making professional looking videos and it all happens before you ever pick up your camera. Your first step, figure out what your video is gonna be about. Easiest way
to look great on camera is to know what you're going to say. If you have a lot of points to cover or you're not very comfortable ad libbing, it might be a good idea to write out a script. This could be as simple as a list of key points you wanna make or as complicated as writing everything word for word. If you're going to sync to a presentation, you want to figure out what you want to say for each slide.
Or if you're planning to do
a screen capture
or demonstration,
you'll plan on each step
you want to show.
Then practice it.
Make sure you feel comfortable.
That the steps flow naturally
in the order you have them.
And that everything
looks and sounds
the way you want it to
before you have
the pressure of the camera.

Next, decide what format
you want to shoot the video in.
Are you going
to use your webcam?
A phone, a screen recording?
What equipment you have
will of course play a role.
But when you've got
multiple options,
you should pick your equipment
based on what your video
is trying to achieve.
If you're making a tutorial,
you may just want to use
a screen recording and audio.
Possibly, with a little bit
from your webcam
at the beginning and the end,
if you wanna edit in an intro.
Webcams can also be
just a tiny bit easier
to get files from.
Since the file will already be
on your computer.
But if the video is going to be
mostly showing people,
you'll want to use a camera.
The camera in your phone
is just fine.
Today's phones
have awesome cameras.
Just use a tripod to aim,
they're cheap and easy to find.
Why is your phone
better than a web cam?
Well, for one thing,
the video quality is better.
It will look better on its own
and if you wanna do
a little editing afterward.
You'll have been quality file
to work with.

Finally, pick
what you're going to wear,
I know, I know it sounds
really shallow, right?
But what you wear in the video
can make
a surprising difference.
For one thing, you want to avoid
really busy patterns
or tiny prints,
they just don't film well.
They're distracting
and on some cameras
can even look almost like
they're vibrating.
Stick to bigger patterns
or solids.

Avoid jewelry that makes noise.
Jangling bracelets for example,
will make it harder
to hear you clearly.

Glasses can sometimes
cause problems,
if a light reflects
off of them wrong,
no one can see your eyes.
It's okay
to have a little reflection,
but you don't want it
to be like this.

The best idea is just
take a short test video
and see if you like the way
you look on screen.
Don't get through your
entire presentation perfectly
and then realize afterward
that your clothes are getting
more attention than your talk.

That's it.
Now, you're ready
to film your video.
Good luck.">
